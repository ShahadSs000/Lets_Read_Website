     hear me out"...<br>
    The lazy beggar, in a small town nearby, there lived a kind of fisherman named Finn. he was a generous and a hard-working man, every day he woke up early and went to work and later in the evening he would come and sell fish in the market and on lots of dimes. one fine day as the fisherman was on his way to  work he was
      stopped by a bagger “oh ,generous man spare me a few dimes, I haven’t had a grain of food in the past few days” “here you go my friend” the next day then finn again stopped by the beggar “oh generous man spare me a few dimes ,I am hungry" “ here you go ,eat well “ <br>
    the next day finn was stopped by the beggar yet again , but this time finn had an idea that the beggar was is just lazy he was a perfectly healthy man and he could get any job if he worked hard enough. <br>“my friend here are a few dimes for today, but I have a greater reward for you  if you come by the river to meet me
     tomorrow morning” "A reward ? Tomorrow morning? okay I’ll be there!"<br> 
    next day as the Sun rises. the beggar weaks up with excitement in search of a greater reward,  to the fisherman surprised that beggar was already there by the river before the fishermen  arrived.<br> -“hello there you are here before time I like the spirit young man” <br>-“good morning"
    -“here ,throw this fishnet in the river and wait for your reward"<br> -“what kind of a reward is this?"<br>-“well, the reward isn’t here yet, you will have to wait" <br>-“umm okay” the beggar throws the fishnet in the river, and paces up  down impatiently by the shore, Finn carefully watches his behaviour and says the next
     thing “hey take it easy be patient ,come sit down with me"<br> -“is this what you do every day? Don’t you get frustrated working so hard and waiting so long by the river?”<br>
    -“ha ha.. oh no my friend I give my best and wait patiently every day, the reward and contentment that I get later is worth it all. Oh, look you can now pull back the fishing net to the shore"<br>the beggar jumps with excitement and pulls  the fishing net towards him he stand when he notices that the fishing net is filled with
     dozens of healthy fish.<br> -“and here is the reward that you waited so patiently for, you can now go to the market and sell it off to earn some dimes,  you don’t have to beg anymore ,if you worked hard for yourself and not be lazy"<br>
    “oh ,kind man. I get the whole point of this now , thank you so much for teaching such an important lesson”<br> 
    "Wow that was an awesome story Tia,I feel like I let my laziness overcome my patience and ability to work hard"<br>“good job boy you got this”</p>
