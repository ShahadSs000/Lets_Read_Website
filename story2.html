    <h4>The boy who cried wolf!</h4>
<pre>
There once was a young shepherd boy named Peter.
His job was to look after a big flock of sheep for his village.

One morning, Peter awoke as usual and herded the sheep up into the hills.
The weather wasn't very nice, so Peter couldn't sunbathe.

The people of the village heard his screams, leaving their houses and their work to rush up the hillside.
"Don't worry, Peter!" they shouted back, "We will help to chase it away!".

"There's no wolf at all!" he giggled, "But you all did look funny running up the hill."
"Don't cry 'wolf', Peter," said the villagers angrily, "you've wasted all our time today."

WOLF! WOLF!" he screamed, "The sheep are scattering!" The villagers heard his cries
again, and all started back up the hill.
"How dare you, Peter!" said the villagers.
"You are taking advantage of our kind hearts. You can be sure we won't be up here to help you again."

As the afternoon wore on, the sheep began to nervously shuffle around.
Peter could tell something was wrong, but he wasn't sure what it was.

The villagers heard him once again, but just huffed and puffed to each other.
"Does he really think we'll fall for that gain?" they muttered, as they carried on with their work.
"He's more stupid than we thought!"

An old man volunteered to go up the hillside to find Peter.
He found him sitting on a rock, with no sheep in sight.
He was weeping into his hands.

Peter understood that he had taken advantage of the villagers' kind nature.
"I'm sure if you came back to the village to apologize, everyone will forgive you" said the
old man.

So Peter plucked up all his courage and did as at the old man said, climbing down the hill and walking home shamefaced.
The villagers were happy to see him home safe.

"We accept your apology, Peter!" they said, "And tomorrow we'll help you find the lost sheep, on one condition:
never cry wolf again!"

<h3>Moral of the story is :Don’t play with people’s trust.
    When it matters the most, they won’t believe you.</h3>
