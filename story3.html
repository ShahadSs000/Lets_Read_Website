   <h4>The Fox and the Stork!</h4>
   <br>

   <pre>
Once upon a time there lived a fox who always made fun of his neighbor- the Stork! One
day the fox thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the stork! "You must
come and dine with me today" he said to the stork, smiling himself at the trick he was
going to play. 
The stork gladly accepted the invitation. He arrived at the right time, and with a very
good appetite! The fox served soup for the dinner. But it was set out in a very shallow
dish! The stork, because of his long beak couldn't even get a drop of soup, and all he
could do was wet his beak! 
The Fox lapped up the soup easily, and to increase the disappointment of the stork,
made a great show of enjoyment! The hungry stork was very angry at the fox. But the
stork was a calm and even tempered fellow, so he saw no good in showing his anger
there. Instead. the stork invited the fox for a dinner at his home the next day! 
The fox arrived promptly, and he was very hungry! The stork served fish dinner that had
a very appetizing smell! The stork served the dinner in a tall jar with a very narrow neck!
The stork could easily get at the food with his narrow bill, but all the fox could do was
lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor! The fox then lost his temper
and shouted at the stork for behaving like this. 
The stork then calmly replied "Do not play tricks on your neighbours, unless you can
stand the same treatment yourself!" The fox was ashamed for what he did, and he went
back to his home They both became good friends from that day!
