   <h4>Carrot Shenanigans with Pirate Petey!</h4>
   <br>
   <pre>
One day, a poor farmer suddenly got a goose. It was a special goose that laid one golden
egg every day. "My heavens! This is unbelievable the egg is gold Ha ha ha!" the farmer
said. The poor farmer decided to sell the eggs. And, soon after, he became rich. "That's a
good goose! keep laying those golden eggs!" the farmer said. The farmer became very
greedy. He was now already rich. But, he wanted to become even richer.
"How come the goose lays only one egg a day? There's no way I'm going to become
really rich like this" the farmer said. "There must be a way to collect a bunch of golden
eggs at one time". The farmer became so greedy that all he thought about was getting
richer. "Ooh! I bet there are a bunch of golden eggs inside the goose's belly."the farmer
thought. "I bet if I cut open its belly, I could get them all out at once!"
But, there were no golden eggs inside. In fact, there was nothing inside. "Oh, how could
have been so foolish? My greed has caused me to lose everything now!" the farmed said
disappointedly. At that moment, the farmer understood what he had done. and there
were no more golden eggs. "Oh… my poor eggs…" the farmer cried.
