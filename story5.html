<h4>The Tortoise and the Hare!
   <br>
</h4>
  <pre>
There was once a tortoise that slowly crawled througha forest. A bouncing hare saw the
tortoise and made fun of him. "Make way! Make way! I am bouncing through!" 
"Hey slowpoke! Didn't you hear me?? Move out of the Way!" The angered tortoise
stopped walking and said, "Hey! Let's race to the top of the mountain and see who gets
there faster!"
"Yon think you can beat me? Fine, lets do it"
"Ready.. Set.. Go-!" So, hare bounced away and Tortoise slowly crawled with bullets of
sweat dripping down.
"Hmm... now where is Tortoise? Wow! He is so far behind. It’ll take him forever to catch
up, so l think I’ll take a nap"
While Hare slept, Tortoise never stopped walking. Sure enough, tortoise crawled past
sleepyhead Hare. And, he crawled to the top of the hill.
"Hey Hare! I beat you!" The Tortoise said. "Huh? Wha..What What's going on?" Hare woke
up and scurried up the hill. But... it was too late. Tortoise was already resting under a
tree at the top of the mountain.
"NO..This can't be! lost to slowpoke Tortoise"

   <h3>Moral of the story is:
      When you work hard and persevere, you can achieve your
      goals. Slow and steady wins the race.</h3>
