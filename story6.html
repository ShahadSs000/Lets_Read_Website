   <h4>There Was A Monkey Climbed A Tree!</h4>
   <br>
   <pre>
There was a monkey climbed up a tree,
When he fell down, then down fell he.
 
There was a crow sat on a stone,
When he was gone, then there was none.
 
There was an old wife did eat an apple,
When she had eat two, she had eat a couple.
 
There was a horse going to the mill,
When he went on, he stood not still.
 
There was a butcher cut his thumb,
When it did bleed, then blood did come.
 
There was a lackey ran a race,
When he ran fast, he ran apace.
 
There was a cobbler clouting shoon,
When they were mended, they were done.
 
There was a chandler making candle,
When he them strip, he did them handle.
 
There was a navy went into Spain,
When it returned, it came again.
